Face Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Generally, the technology works best if it uses multiple modalities in context. To date, the most work has been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions from video, spoken expressions from audio, written expressions from text, and physiology as measured by wearables.

Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. Various studies have been done for the classification of these facial expressions. There is strong evidence for the universal facial expressions of seven emotions which include: neutral happy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. So it is very important to detect these emotions on the face as it has wide applications in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. These fields are researching on the facial emotions to get the sentiments of the humans automatically.
